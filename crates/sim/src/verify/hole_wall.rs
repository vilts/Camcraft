//! The containment kinds' hole-wall excuse in the solid law (#1205): a
//! round hole imported as an inscribed n-gon stands inside its true
//! circle by each facet's sagitta, so a round tool finishing that circle
//! enters the facets by up to that much - the tessellation, not a cut.
//! The excuse is MEASURED, not assumed: a facet's sagitta about the
//! hole's own axis is its nearest vertex's radius less its nearest
//! approach to the axis (point-to-segment / point-in-triangle distance
//! in the plane square to the axis), and only a facet whose sagitta is
//! at most [`WALL_SAG`] reads as a round wall. A flat (a D-bore, a hex
//! or an octagon, a hole imported too coarse to be round) passes far
//! inside its corners' circle and is part steel like any other.
//!
//! Before #1205 the excuse was the dip of the facet's edges into the
//! TOOL's own disc, a bound that grows as the tool shrinks against the
//! hole; it let a thread mill cut 0.32 mm into an octagon's flats with no
//! warning. The excuse kept is never larger than that bound.
//!
//! Provenance: chord sagitta and point-to-segment distance from
//! elementary geometry; the cap is our own design (decision record
//! `docs/decisions/1205-hole-wall-nearest-point.md`). No vendor source.
