//! Law (f2), the posed-contact law: a LEANING pose on a cutting move
//! of a ball finish is a claim of contact. The lean laws that author
//! these poses (the stamp's surface-normal lean, the swarf ruling, the
//! drive curve's fan rest) are functions of the contact normal under
//! the ball - no contact, no normal, no lean - so a cutting move that
//! holds a lean while its ball stands off the part is a path whose
//! pose and position disagree: the ball is not where the plan put it.
//! That is the pivot-law failure class (a pose turned about the TIP
//! instead of the ball centre carries the ball `r·(a - up)` off its
//! skin), and it is invisible to the envelope's other halves: the
//! facet gouge law sees no bite in air, and the ridge rest law only
//! judges surface points two passes came near - which an all-air
//! pass never is.
//!
//! The one lean that does NOT claim contact is the shank escape (M5.1
//! stage F): a ball in air leans because the upright shank or holder
//! at the same centre would touch the part. It is excused exactly
//! when that is true - the upright band stack at the same ball centre
//! enters the solid ([`super::solid_index`], the solid law's own
//! exact reader). Everything else is judged: the ball centre (tip
//! plus `r` along the pose, the stream's tip contract) must stand
//! within `r + tol + leave + band` of the mesh, `band` the stamp's
//! micron contact lattice.
//!
//! A feed whose pose CHANGES between two leans (M13.7's mid-move
//! reading, [`super::midpose`]) claims contact all along it: its
//! ball is also judged at the poses the controller lerps between the
//! ends, interval by interval, at the worst gap of the move. A plunge
//! is an entry: only its end claims (the law judged it there before,
//! and still does).
//!
//! Upright moves are not judged here: an upright cut claims nothing
//! (rasters cross open floor, links and roughing levels clear air by
//! design), and "every path point must touch" would convict all of
//! them. The verdict reads as [`Warning::Envelope`] rest - material
//! the claimed contact never reached - at the worst move.
//!
//! Provenance: ball-centre / tool-tip CL geometry and tangency from
//! public multi-axis CAM literature (ISO 6983 tool-length practice);
//! point-to-triangle distance from Ericson, "Real-Time Collision
//! Detection" 5.1 (via `stock_sim::dist_seg_tri`). Our own law; no
//! vendor material consulted.
