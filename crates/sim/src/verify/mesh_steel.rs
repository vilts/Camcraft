//! The fixture laws (c2)/(d2) read against the fixture's real mesh
//! (#339): the box laws stay the broad phase, and a fixture whose
//! closed mesh is at hand gets the last word on every upright move its
//! box flagged. A path through the gap between two vise jaws - inside
//! the vise's one world box, nowhere near its steel - is then clean,
//! while a band clipping a jaw corner still blocks the post.
//!
//! ## The law here: the mesh only ever ACQUITS
//!
//! A move leaves the report only when every box that flagged it is a
//! meshed fixture whose mesh proves the move clear ([`judge_move`]);
//! the mesh never adds a hit the boxes did not make. So the box laws'
//! own silences (the strict-dip z rule: stock seated on a plate, a
//! retract off the mounting face) stand untouched, and a false hit can
//! only ever survive where the box already hit. Where nothing is
//! acquitted the report is the box laws' own, byte for byte.
//!
//! Judged by the mesh here: upright moves (held and stated pose both
//! upright - the frames agree, and the stack is the vertical column
//! the box laws read), the spindle's C angle at zero, straight or arcs
//! in any plane (XZ/YZ chorded in their own plane with the XY arcs'
//! pad, slice 3). Posed and C-turned moves are read by
//! [`super::mesh_posed`] (slice 3), in the frame each steel set is
//! judged in. A box two fixtures share, an open or refused mesh, and
//! whatever [`super::mesh_posed`] cannot place: the box verdict stands.
//!
//! Proven clear means, for every band of the stack (shank, holder, the
//! spindle housing when stated, flute - the box laws' order), along
//! every chord of the move: a GJK-proven gap of more than
//! [`FIXTURE_HIT_TOL`] plus the chord's own deviation from the arc to
//! every facet near it, and the band not standing inside the solid
//! (the swept band is connected and meets no facet, so one point
//! decides). See [`crate::fixture_mesh`] for why each answer is
//! conservative. The stack is the same one for rapids: an upright rapid
//! the boxes flagged keeps its hit if ANY band meets the steel - the
//! same whole stack the rapid box law (d2) sweeps since #424
//! ([`super::stack_span`]), named the way that law names it: a band
//! above the flute by its part, the flute itself as the rapid.
//!
//! Provenance: our own composition of the box laws with the mesh tests
//! of [`crate::fixture_mesh`] (GJK, BVH, ray-crossing inclusion -
//! published methods cited there); the chord-to-arc deviation is the
//! sagitta of elementary geometry. No vendor source consulted.
