//! Law (d)'s solid-aware second reading for POSED rapids: a lateral
//! rapid under a leaning tool that the column law convicts is re-read
//! against the part's solid and the open stock above it, not the
//! height field alone. The column law reads a rapid as a vertical
//! tool at its lowest Z and asks whether its three XY columns carry
//! material above that height - exact for an upright tool over open
//! stock, and blind by construction under an overhang: the air below
//! a ledge, below a tube's equator, reads as the stock standing above
//! it. A swarf link retracts along the contact normal - DOWN and
//! outward under the equator - so its every column reads a surface
//! top above it, and the flank it carries never enters the blade.
//!
//! The second reading samples the rapid as the controller runs it:
//! the tip along its line, the pose lerped between the held and the
//! stated one ([`super::midpose`]), and at every sample the stack
//! along the pose ([`super::probe::Cutter`]). It convicts when
//!
//! - the swept stack enters the PART solid - the solid law's own exact
//!   reader ([`super::solid_index`]), the part being stock that no
//!   cut ever removes; or
//! - a sample of the axis stands in OPEN stock: inside the stock
//!   footprint, under the stock top, with no part material at or
//!   above it (`slice::material_overhead`, read through
//!   [`super::rest::Rest::part_over`]) and below the column's
//!   cut-order surface ([`super::rest::Rest::surface_before`]) -
//!   there the column law is exact and keeps its word.
//!
//! What it stops convicting is the air under an overhang that no cut
//! reached: the column cannot tell that air from stock and the mesh
//! says it is outside the part. The upright reading (and every
//! unposed program, a stated upright included) is untouched; a
//! context without a model has no overhang to misread and never
//! asks. The overhead is read on a plane rounded UP to [`STEP`] - less
//! of the part stands above a higher plane, so rounding only adds
//! convictions. A mesh the solid reader cannot index, or a plane it
//! cannot slice, fails closed: the column verdict stands.
//!
//! Provenance: the sampling bound is [`super::posed_steel`]'s; the
//! modal pose rule RS-274's; swept-stack-against-solid is textbook
//! (Ericson, "Real-Time Collision Detection", public material). Our
//! own design; no vendor material consulted.
