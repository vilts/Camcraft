//! The tool stack's true z span along a move, for the fixture laws
//! (c2) and (d2) (#424, #425). A band of the stack (flute, shank,
//! holder, the spindle housing) rides the tip: over a move it sweeps
//! every z from its window at the low end to its window at the high
//! end. Law (c2) used to stand every band at the move's deepest z, so
//! on a ramp or a plunge the top of the stack at the high end went
//! unjudged (#425); law (d2) swept only the flute disc along an
//! upright rapid, so the shank, holder and housing were never judged
//! on a rapid at all (#424).
//!
//! The window here, per straight piece of the tip path, is
//! `[min(floor, piece low) + lo, piece high + hi]`: the band's extent
//! at both ends, min to max, on the piece's own z (an arc's chords,
//! each at its own height - [`Move::segments3`]). `floor` is the
//! law's historical bottom (the move's lower end for (c2)), so the
//! window only ever GROWS over the one the law always read: every old
//! verdict stands, a level move's window is the old one sum for sum,
//! and the new hits are steel the stack really reaches at the high end.
//! An enclosing window over-reports a graze on a long ramp, never hides
//! a crash - the bands law's own precedent.
//!
//! An arc's chords are padded by what its circle adds to them (#491,
//! [`super::arc_bulge`]): each band's radius grows by the horizontal
//! part of the chord's deviation (the sagitta, plus the lattice pad),
//! and a vertical arc's window is its true z range between the joints.
//! A straight move pads nothing.
//!
//! The z test stays [`crate::fixture::band_hits_box`]'s: overlap must
//! be strict beyond tolerance. So the strict-dip silences hold for the
//! whole stack - a retract off a mounting face (the tip leaving
//! exactly the box top) keeps every band at or above the steel, and
//! flush contact is not a crash.
//!
//! Provenance: the swept volume of a coaxial cylinder carried along a
//! straight segment, enclosed by its end windows - elementary solid
//! geometry; the band/box predicate is the crate's own
//! (`crate::fixture`). Our own design; no vendor source consulted.
