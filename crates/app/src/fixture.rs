//! Fixture modeling: the workholding hardware a part rides on (M3.2
//! stage B). A fixture is an ordinary model - a STEP the user loaded -
//! wearing a [`FixtureDef`] marker; the machine's own table is derived
//! from the loaded `.mch` and is never an entity.
//!
//! Provenance: our own domain model, specced from general machining
//! knowledge and machine-tool handbooks - vises and chucks are the
//! shop's parts, so the program imports them rather than inventing
//! parametric stand-ins. The table is the machine's stated travel box.
//! No vendor geometry, model, or implementation was inspected.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **A fixture is a model.** Its geometry is the `Facets` the importer
//!   put there, its pose is the entity `Location` - the same two
//!   components every part uses. The marker carries only the setup
//!   binding. There is no fixture-shaped geometry builder: whatever
//!   `boxes_for` reports for a tagged model is the world AABB of its
//!   loaded mesh, exactly what the part itself would report.
//! - **The machine table is derived, never stored.** It exists only
//!   while a machine file states its XY travel and Z bottom: footprint =
//!   the X/Y spans, top = the Z-travel minimum (the lowest the quill can
//!   reach is the surface work stands on), extending downward by
//!   [`MAX_FIXTURE_DIM`] - its underside can never be approached from
//!   below, so its depth is law-irrelevant and stated as the module's
//!   own absurd-dimension cap. No machine, or unstated limits, or a
//!   table with them: the unstated-limit law, exactly as the limit
//!   checker reads it.
//! - **World boxes are corner-AABBs: conservative by construction.**
//!   The AABB of transformed geometry is never smaller than the geometry,
//!   and for a rotated fixture it is a slightly LARGER box than the tilted
//!   reality. Fixtures are never gouge-relevant (they are not cut
//!   material), so a false hit merely annoys while a false negative is a
//!   silent crash: every tolerance here errs toward HIT.
//! - **The mesh acquits, the box convicts (#339).** The box laws stay
//!   the broad phase; a tagged model's closed world mesh
//!   ([`meshes_for`]) then clears the moves its box flagged but its
//!   real steel does not meet - a path down a vise's gap, upright, posed
//!   or under a rotary (slice 3, `verify::mesh_posed`). The mesh
//!   never adds a hit, and an open or refused mesh keeps its box
//!   verdict (`camcraft_sim::verify::mesh_refined`).
//! - **Steel is not kerf.** A retract through its own hole in STOCK is
//!   safe (the material was removed); a retract or rapid dipping through
//!   a fixture box is a crash, so the rapid law's vertical exemption
//!   does not carry over - see [`rapid_hits_box`].
//! - **The strict-dip z law.** A rapid whose span only TOUCHES a box top
//!   within tolerance is not reported: stock seated exactly on a table
//!   top would otherwise fire on every retract, and mating surfaces
//!   contact by design. The dip must exceed [`FIXTURE_HIT_TOL`] to
//!   count - stated because it is the one place this module errs toward
//!   SILENCE, and the margin is a float-dust tolerance, not clearance.
//! - **Workholding never rides the stamp.** Fixtures, the table box and
//!   the spindle band are LIVE gate inputs, exactly like the M2.3 machine
//!   limits: generation reports what the steel says right then, the post
//!   re-checks here and now ([`crate::posting::verification_gate`]), and
//!   no fixture or machine action can stale an otherwise fresh toolpath.
//!   "Load the roomy machine, post without re-generating" is the law this
//!   keeps; a moved vise is caught at the gate, never smuggled in as a
//!   stamp difference.
