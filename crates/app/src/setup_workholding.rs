//! A setup's workholding rpm limit (#1031): the rated maximum rpm of the
//! chuck or collet a lathe setup holds the work in. A chuck's jaws lose
//! grip force as the spindle speeds up, so its rating is a ceiling of its
//! own, beside the machine's spindle maximum and the tool's max rpm, and
//! it belongs to the setup (the same tool in another chuck has another
//! limit). `None`, the default and every earlier file, states none.
//!
//! ## What it does to a program
//!
//! - **Constant surface speed (G96).** The section's rpm ceiling, the
//!   `PARAM MaxSpindleSpeed` the lathe posts clamp to (Fanuc `G50 S`,
//!   Tormach `G96 D`), becomes the lower of the tool's own and the
//!   workholding's ([`css_of`]); the posts take the lower of that and
//!   the machine's, so the clamp is min(machine, tool, workholding).
//! - **Constant rpm (G97).** An operation whose section the lathe post
//!   opens on the work spindle (any kind, #1174) at an rpm over its
//!   setup's limit is refused by name at the program gate
//!   ([`program_problems`]), never silently capped: the cut was planned
//!   at that rpm, so the fix is the user's to choose.
//! - **C-axis live tooling.** The section's S is the live tool's; the
//!   work turns only on C, judged by the machine's C rate (#1174).
//!
//! Provenance: our own design (#1031); the hazard (jaw grip force falls
//! with speed, so chucks carry a rated maximum rpm) is general machining
//! knowledge from the machine-tool handbooks' workholding chapters. No
//! vendor material consulted.
