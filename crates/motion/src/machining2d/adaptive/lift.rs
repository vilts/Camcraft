//! Microlift returns (M11.4 C round 4): the growth rings' spiral, cut
//! climb-only and staying down, rides the whole cleared outline every
//! revolution - in a channel, a 0.25 mm advance per loop buys a wall
//! ride of twice the channel's length. Here the spiral is cut only
//! where it bites: its revolutions are split at their air stretches
//! (read on the planner's own stock, `raster`; `lift_split`), the biting
//! pieces kept exactly as planned, and each piece is reached from the
//! last by a lifted return - up off the floor by [`MICROLIFT`], straight
//! across stock already cleared, down onto the piece's air lead - the
//! return loop of trochoidal and adaptive milling taken above the floor
//! instead of along the walls (Otkur & Lazoglu 2007, "Trochoidal
//! milling", Int. J. Mach. Tools Manuf. 47, the cutting arc and its
//! non-cutting return; Pateloup, Duc & Ray 2004, "Corner optimization
//! for pocket machining", Int. J. Mach. Tools Manuf. 44, links taken
//! off the cut to keep the cutting path's dynamics; Ibaraki et al.
//! 2010, the constant-engagement trochoid's return arc).
//!
//! The pieces are re-ordered front by front: a piece waits only for
//! the pieces before it in the spiral that come within reach of its
//! reading (two rims), so every piece meets the stock it was planned
//! on, and the next piece is the nearest one ready - a channel's front
//! is cut loop after loop, its return across the channel, before the
//! next front is visited. Every piece is the spiral's own (the spiral
//! never crosses itself, so no two pieces cross); every return is a
//! straight chord inside the center area, its swept disc on no stock
//! and no wall, crossing no other return and no entry orbit, landing
//! where the rim reads no stock - or the ladder's own retract hop where
//! none is. The easing laps are split the same way on the stock the
//! pieces left; the last lap is cut whole. The re-ordered plan is
//! walked on a fresh stock and kept only if it reads no worse than the
//! spiral. Ours; the schedule, the pads and the lift are our choices.
