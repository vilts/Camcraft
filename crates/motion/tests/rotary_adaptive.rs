//! Adaptive on the rotary developed wrap (issue #9), specced from the
//! wrap/development literature in `multiaxis::wrap_exit` and the HSM
//! planner's own load and kink laws; no vendor material consulted.
//!
//! Issue #9: Adaptive clearing on the rotary developed wrap. Each
//! developed level (s the arc length at the wrap's radius, v the
//! station, height the radius) goes to the HSM planner exactly as a
//! planar 3-D level does; the planned path is wrapped back by the wrap
//! exit's own chord law (no developed arc stays an arc on the
//! cylinder). Read here: the load each planned level holds and its
//! in-cut breaks past 5 degrees, measured on the DEVELOPED path from
//! the clamped bar's skin; the planner's own overload notes; the same kink law
//! on the POSTED world program pulled back into the developed frame
//! (its chorded arcs); every world move posed radial; each level rings
//! cut (read from the program's shape, not its notes) named by radius; OffsetRings move for move what it always was (digest
//! read without the patch). The seam law itself (`hsm::Seam`) is pinned
//! by its unit test in `machining3d::hsm`.
//!
//! Gate map (M4.4): covers camcraft_motion::multiaxis (rotary_offset,
//! wrap_exit), camcraft_motion::machining3d (hsm, entry), and
//! camcraft_motion::quality, on this suite's own revolve fixtures.
//! Lane shape (M4.4): the rings digest and the narrow window's refusal
//! (issue #55, rings only) run in seconds in debug; the Adaptive plans
//! (window ~3 min, r6.2 bar ~3 min, whole bar ~10 min debug) are the
//! heavy lane's (release --ignored, ~1 min). The fixtures and the level
//! reader live in `rotary_adaptive_fixture/`.
