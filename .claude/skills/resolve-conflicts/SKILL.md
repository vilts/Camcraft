description: Re-check open pull requests that conflict with main and get them mergeable again. Contributor mode (`/resolve-conflicts` or `/resolve-conflicts <login>`) - for the given author (default the gh user), finds their open PRs that conflict with upstream main, merges main into each branch, resolves the usual easy conflicts (both sides added lines, module lists, tests, snapshot PNGs), runs the targeted gate, pushes, and comments that the PR is ready for a re-check. Maintainer mode (`/resolve-conflicts check`) - re-reads every PR labelled `conflicts`, drops the label from those that merge cleanly again, and routes each to the review it needs. Use for "fix my conflicts", "rebase my PRs on main", "which PRs still conflict", "did the contributors resolve their conflicts".

# resolve-conflicts - get conflicting PRs mergeable again

Part of AGENTS.md's Autonomous Work Law ("Conflicted PRs are re-merged by
their author; the maintainer re-checks"). Merging other PRs moves `main`,
and a reviewed PR that merged cleanly yesterday can conflict today. Most
of these conflicts are mechanical: both sides added an entry to the same
module list, test list, match or file. This skill fixes those, and stops
and reports when the two sides really clash.

Since 2026-11-12 a conflicting PR is refreshed **only at merge time**
(AGENTS.md "Refresh only at merge time", issue #1221): it carries
`conflicts` and is otherwise left alone, by its author's agents, by
maintenance and by reviewers. Nobody refreshes all of them at session
start. The merging session (or the author, when asked for one named PR)
runs this skill on the PR the merge batch is about to merge, in the order
`cargo xtask merge-plan` gives. Its delta check after a refresh is
`cargo xtask merge-plan --delta <PR> --reviewed <sha>`.

Repository: NeoTech/Camcraft (`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner`; in a
fork, `upstream` is NeoTech/Camcraft and `origin` is the fork).

**Two modes:**
- `/resolve-conflicts [login]` - **contributor mode**: fix *your* PRs (or
  `login`'s, if you can push to their branches).
- `/resolve-conflicts check` - **maintainer mode**: re-check every PR
  labelled `conflicts` and update its state.

## 0. Preconditions

- Never during a release cut (an open PR from a `release/*` branch): stop
  and say so.
- Never force-push and never rebase. Always `git merge` (merge commits keep
  the hashes reviews and comments refer to).
- Never build in the main checkout. Work in a worktree under
  `.claude/worktrees/` with its own `target/` (the worktree default, no `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` env var - it defeats the shared compile cache); remove both when done.
- Build cache: Prefer `cargo xtask gate ...` (it turns the compile cache on); for a direct cargo call set `RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache` only when `sccache` is on PATH (cargo fails if the wrapper is missing), and never export `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.
- A PR flagged ready and labelled `merge-ready` takes no pushes (AGENTS.md
  "Every PR opens as a draft"). A conflicting PR has already lost
  `merge-ready` (the label is `conflicts`), so pushing a merge to it is
  allowed. If the PR is still marked ready (ours or a contributor's), run
  `gh pr ready <N> --undo` before pushing and say why in a PR comment -
  except a refresh that is only a merge of main with no hand edits
  (`cargo xtask merge-plan --delta` says SAME; AGENTS.md "Every PR opens as
  a draft", superseded since 2026-11-12 by the decision "Refresh only at
  merge time", issue #1221): that one is pushed as it is, and the comment
  says so.
- The ready flag after a merge-time refresh is the merging session's: when
  it refreshes a PR for the batch and `--delta` says SAME, or MECHANICAL
  after its own read, the merging session flags the PR ready (`gh pr ready
  <N>`) right before it merges it, with one PR comment naming the class.
  Nothing is pushed after that flag. A PR under an orange `conflicts` verdict
  is a draft (review-prs), so this step is what makes it mergeable again.
  A contributor does the flag on their own PR; when you can't (someone else's
  PR you only have push access to), say in the comment that it should be
  re-flagged ready after the re-check.

## 1. Contributor mode - `/resolve-conflicts [login]`

### 1a. Find the PRs

```bash
me=${LOGIN:-$(gh api user --jq .login)}
gh pr list --repo NeoTech/Camcraft --state open --author "$me" --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,headRefName,headRepositoryOwner,isDraft,mergeable,labels
```

Re-read `mergeable` for each (retry while `UNKNOWN`, up to ~6 tries). Work
only on the PR the merge batch is about to merge - the next PR of wave 2
in `cargo xtask merge-plan <PRs>` - or the one PR the author named. Never
every `CONFLICTING` PR at once: an early refresh is undone by the next
merge to main and costs a delta review (AGENTS.md "Refresh only at merge
time"). Order stacks parent first: if PR B contains PR A's commits (A's head
is an ancestor of B's head, `git merge-base --is-ancestor`), fix A first,
then merge A's fixed branch into B before main.

### 1b. For each PR

1. **Worktree on the PR branch** (your fork's branch):
   `git fetch upstream` (or `origin` in the canonical repo), then
   `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/rc-<N> <branch>`.
2. **Merge main:** `git merge upstream/main` (or `origin/main`).
3. **Resolve, by kind:**
   - **Both sides added** (module lists in `lib.rs`/`mod.rs`, test module
     lists, `pub mod` lines, enum variants, match arms, struct fields,
     separate functions, separate tests, menu items, machine-file entries):
     keep both, in a sensible order. This is the common case.
   - **Snapshot PNGs** (`crates/ui/tests/snapshots/*.png`): take main's.
     While merging main into the PR branch, "theirs" is main:
     `git checkout --theirs -- crates/ui/tests/snapshots` (or
     `git checkout upstream/main -- crates/ui/tests/snapshots`). A PR never
     changes a snapshot PNG (AGENTS.md "Pixel
     snapshots are release-lane"). Update the structural assertions
     instead if the UI changed.
   - **`CHANGELOG.md` / `RECOMMENDED.md`:** a PR shouldn't touch these
     (the cut writes them). Take main's and drop the PR's edit.
   - **`.claude/PROCESS_VERSION`:** take the higher number, then add 1 if
     this PR changes process files and main already used that number.
   - **The same logic changed differently on both sides** (two rewrites of
     one function body, two different fixes of one check, a refactor that
     moved code main edited in place): **stop.** Don't guess. `git merge
     --abort`, leave the branch untouched, and report the hunk: file,
     function, what each side does. A rule that keeps safety
     checks (per-setup spindle, carried stock, refusals by name) must never
     be dropped by a resolution - when in doubt, it's this case.
4. **Check nothing from main was dropped:** `git diff upstream/main --stat`
   must list only the PR's own files.
5. **Targeted gate** (AGENTS.md "Test the change"): `cargo xtask gate
   quick --base upstream/main` on any OS (wrappers `scripts/gate.ps1` /
   `gate.sh` forward to it), or by hand: build the touched
   crates; run the test binaries of the files that conflicted plus the
   PR's own pinning tests; `cargo clippy -p <touched crates> --all-targets
   -- -D warnings`. UI tests with CWD `crates/ui`. Run in the foreground
   with timeouts. Red -> fix the resolution if it's yours; if the failure is
   in main's code or the PR's logic, stop and report.
6. **Commit** the merge: `Merge main into <branch> (<files>: keep both
   sides)` (plus `Co-Authored-By` if an agent did it). **Push** plainly
   (`git push origin <branch>` - never `--force`).
7. **Comment on the PR:** `Merged main to resolve conflicts (<files>: keep
   both sides). Targeted gate: <results>. Ready for a re-check
   (/resolve-conflicts check).` Contributors can't change labels; the
   maintainer's check does that.
8. Remove the worktree and its target (cd out first).

### 1c. Report

One line per PR: merged & pushed (with the gate result), or stopped (with
the hunk that needs a human decision), or still conflicting after the
push (rare - main moved again; run once more).

## 2. Maintainer mode - `/resolve-conflicts check`

For every open PR labelled `conflicts` (plus any open PR that GitHub now
reports `CONFLICTING` without the label - add the label to those):

1. Re-read `mergeable` (retry while `UNKNOWN`).
2. **Still `CONFLICTING`:** keep `conflicts` and leave the PR alone. Ask the
   author only when the PR is in the batch the merging session is about to
   merge (`cargo xtask merge-plan --label merge-ready` puts it in wave 2);
   otherwise say nothing, and never ask for a refresh of a PR that is not
   about to merge (AGENTS.md "Refresh only at merge time"). When asked, and
   no comment since the label was set already asks the author to merge main,
   post one (once):
   `This conflicts with main. Please run /resolve-conflicts (or git merge
   upstream/main, keep both sides) and push. The usual cause is that both
   sides added lines in the same place.` If the author's fork refuses
   maintainer pushes and the maintainer wants it merged now, the
   replacement-branch route applies (fix on a branch in our repo, PR with
   their commits kept; GitHub then shows the original PR as merged).
3. **Now `MERGEABLE`:** remove `conflicts`, then decide what review it needs.
   Run `cargo xtask merge-plan --delta <PR> --reviewed <sha>`, where the sha
   is the last reviewed head: the one in the collaborator-authored
   `<!-- pr-reviewer: ... -->` marker (AGENTS.md "Only collaborators' reviews
   count"; a marker by a non-collaborator does not count).
   - **SAME** (head unchanged, or only merges of main with an empty
     remerge-diff - AGENTS.md "A clean merge of main keeps its review"): the
     tree is what merging the reviewed head would give. Restore `merge-ready`
     with no agent and no delta review.
   - **MECHANICAL** (hand edits only in rule-settled files: `.claude/
     PROCESS_VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `RECOMMENDED.md`, `Cargo.lock`, PNGs
     taken from main): the merging session reads `git show --remerge-diff
     <merge>` itself, and restores `merge-ready` when it is right.
   - **DELTA** (a conflict was resolved by hand): a **delta review** - a
     reviewer checks only the remerge-diff of those merges (both sides kept,
     nothing from main dropped, targeted tests; rebuild only if logic was
     merged by hand). Its labels follow the review-prs table (step 2b):
     `needs-rework` if the resolution is wrong, `conflicts` if main moved
     again, `needs-maintainer` if the merge brought in a dependency,
     `build.rs`, scripts or `.github` change the reviewer only reads.
   - **NEW CODE** or **Rewritten** (new code commits, or the history was
     rewritten): a full review via `/review-prs`.
4. Report one line per PR: still conflicting (author asked), clean again
   (label restored), sent to delta review, sent to full review.

## 3. Notes

- This skill never merges a PR into main; merging stays with `/merge-ready`
  or the maintainer.
- Contributors running it from a fork use their own `gh` login; the
  maintainer runs it from the canonical repo.
- Changing this skill is a process change: bump `.claude/PROCESS_VERSION`
  and announce it on the pinned issue #681.
