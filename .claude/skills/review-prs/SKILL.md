# Review open pull requests

The `PR-reviewer` agent (`.claude/agents/PR-reviewer.md`) does the review of
one PR. This skill decides which PRs need it and dispatches it. The maintainer
approves and merges by hand - nothing here approves, merges or pushes.

## 0. One review at a time - the lock

PR reviews never run concurrently (user, 2026-11-07: "make sure we are not
running concurrent PR reviews"): each one builds the whole workspace, and a
loop tick can fire while the previous review is still building. The lock is
the file `.claude/pr-review.lock` in the repo root (gitignored), one line:
`<PR number> <head sha> <UTC ISO time>`.

```bash
lock="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/pr-review.lock"
if [ -f "$lock" ]; then cat "$lock"; find "$lock" -mmin +90; fi
```

- Lock present and younger than 90 min (the `find` prints nothing): a review
  is running. Say "a PR review is already running (#N since T)" in one line
  and stop - do not dispatch, do not queue.
- Lock older than 90 min: stale (a review that died). Check no
  `../cc-pr*-review` worktree is still building (`git worktree list`); if none,
  delete the lock, say "removed a stale PR-review lock (#N)", and go on.
  If a review worktree remains, remove it (`git worktree remove --force`,
  `git branch -D pr-<N>-review`) before going on.
- Also stop if a `PR-reviewer` agent you launched is still running in this
  session.

## 1. Find PRs that need a review

**Only PRs marked ready for review are reviewed - never a draft** (user,
2026-11-08: "Update the review-prs skill to only review PRs that is ready
to review"; AGENTS.md "Every PR opens as a draft"). A draft is still being
worked on and may take more pushes; reviewing it wastes a full build.

If the user named a PR (`/review-prs 58`), check it first:
`gh pr view <N> --json isDraft,state --jq '.isDraft, .state'`. If it is a
draft (or not open), say "PR #N is a draft - not reviewed until it is marked
ready (`gh pr ready N`)" in one line and stop. Otherwise take just that one
and go to step 2.

Otherwise list open PRs that are ready for review (non-draft) with their head SHA and reviews:

```bash
export COLLABS=$(gh api repos/NeoTech/Camcraft/collaborators --jq '.[] | select(.permissions.push) | .login' | tr '\n' ' ')
gh pr list --repo NeoTech/Camcraft --state open --limit 100 \
  --json number,isDraft,author,headRepositoryOwner,headRefOid,reviews,comments \
  --jq '(env.COLLABS | split(" ")) as $c
        | .[] | select(.isDraft|not)
        | .headRefOid as $s
        | ([.reviews[] | select(.author.login as $a | $c | index($a)) | .body]
           + [.comments[] | select(.author.login as $a | $c | index($a)) | .body]) as $marks
        | select($marks | map(select(contains("<!-- pr-reviewer: " + $s))) | length == 0)
        | "\(.number) \(.author.login) \($s)"'
```

Only a collaborator's marker counts (AGENTS.md "Only collaborators' reviews
count", 2026-11-12: "Any collaborator review counts"; it replaced the
owner-only rule of #1207): a `pr-reviewer` marker posted by an account that
is not a collaborator is not a review of this head. Every line printed
is a PR that needs a review:
- it is ready for review - a fork PR or one of our own (user, 2026-11-08:
  "All PR*s made by owner should be reviewd and tagged"); our own PRs are
  flagged ready by a quick pass (AGENTS.md "Every PR opens as a draft") and
  get their full review here;
- no review or comment by a collaborator carries the marker for its
  current head SHA (a new push after our last review means the contributor
  answered - review again), unless the new commits since that marker are only
  clean merges of main: `cargo xtask merge-plan --delta <N> --reviewed <sha>`
  says SAME, and the review stands (no dispatch; step 2b restores the label).

Nothing to review: say "no PRs need review" in one line and stop (this is the
common case on a loop tick - keep it quiet).

## 2. Dispatch exactly one PR

Take the oldest PR needing review - **one per invocation**; the next loop tick
takes the next. Never launch two `PR-reviewer` agents at once.

1. Write the lock first:
   `echo "<N> <sha> $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ)" > "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/pr-review.lock"`
2. Agent tool, `subagent_type: "PR-reviewer"`, run in the background, prompt:
   `Review PR #<N> of NeoTech/Camcraft (head <sha>). Follow your definition: comment only, own worktree, clean up, remove .claude/pr-review.lock when done.`
3. On its completion notification, make sure the lock is gone (delete it if
   the agent failed to) and that `../cc-pr<N>-review` is removed. Do not poll
   while it runs.

## 2b. Labels - one colour per state

Every reviewed PR carries exactly the labels its state calls for (user,
2026-11-08: "a merge conflict should prob get orange flagged 'conflicts' so
we can find em"):

| Label | Colour | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `merge-ready` | green | review clean AND merges cleanly with main - a collaborator can merge now |
| `needs-rework` | red | the review found blocking items |
| `conflicts` | orange | conflicts with main - needs a branch refresh (`git merge origin/main`) |
| `needs-maintainer` | yellow | reviewed, no blockers, but the owner must decide first: a new dependency, or a `build.rs` / scripts / `.github` change the reviewer reads and does not build ("Not built - needs a maintainer look") |

`needs-maintainer` (user, 2026-11-09: "that needs-maintainer needs to
into the skill right?") gives the "Not built - needs a maintainer look"
verdict a label. Without it such a PR carried none and looked unreviewed
on the PR list. The owner removes it after deciding: on a yes it becomes
`merge-ready`, or is built and reviewed in full first; on a no it is
closed or gets `needs-rework`.

After posting the review, read `gh pr view <N> --json mergeable`
(re-read once if it says `UNKNOWN`):
- clean review + `MERGEABLE` -> add `merge-ready`, remove `needs-rework`, `conflicts` and `needs-maintainer`;
- clean review + `CONFLICTING` -> add `conflicts`, remove `merge-ready` and `needs-maintainer` (never green while it conflicts);
- blocking review -> add `needs-rework`, remove `merge-ready` and `needs-maintainer`; also add `conflicts` if it conflicts;
- "Not built - needs a maintainer look" with no blockers -> add `needs-maintainer`, remove `merge-ready` and `needs-rework`; also add `conflicts` if it conflicts. With blockers it is `needs-rework` as above, and the comment still names the owner's decision.

A PR that changes `crates/ui/tests/snapshots/*.png` is a blocking review
(`needs-rework`): the pixel goldens are release-lane and are regenerated
only at the cut (AGENTS.md "Pixel snapshots are release-lane", #255). The
fix is to drop the PNG changes and update the structural assertions
instead.

A red or orange verdict also turns the PR back into a draft
(`gh pr ready <N> --undo`): the author fixes it there, pushes, and flags it
ready again for a fresh review (AGENTS.md "Every PR opens as a draft").
That applies to our own PRs; a fork contributor's PR is left as they set
it, and the review comment says what to fix.

A conflicting PR of ours that waits for the merge batch therefore stays a
draft until merge time. The merging session refreshes it, and then flags it
ready (`gh pr ready <N>`) right before the merge, with one PR comment naming
the `--delta` class (SAME, MECHANICAL or DELTA) - AGENTS.md "Every PR opens
as a draft", decided in #1221 ("Refresh only at merge time"). The review
skill does not flag ready; it only reads the state.

Whoever refreshes a branch (at merge time, AGENTS.md "Refresh only at merge
time") re-reads `mergeable` after the push: once it is `MERGEABLE`, drop
`conflicts` and restore `merge-ready` if the last review was clean. Run
`cargo xtask merge-plan --delta <PR> --reviewed <sha>` on the merge: SAME
(only merges of main with an empty remerge-diff) keeps the review with no
agent, MECHANICAL is read by the merging session, DELTA gets a delta review,
NEW CODE a full review (AGENTS.md "A clean merge of main keeps its review").
Merging a PR can turn others `CONFLICTING`, so each run also re-checks
every open PR labelled `merge-ready` and swaps any that now conflict to
`conflicts`.

A requested change that is still open on the current head, or `merge-ready`
beside a collaborator review that requests changes, is a disagreement
(AGENTS.md "Only collaborators' reviews count"): no agent removes either
label.

Only collaborators set the review labels and the markers that count
(AGENTS.md "Only collaborators' reviews count"; the collaborator list is
`$COLLABS` above). A `merge-ready` label with no collaborator-authored
`pr-reviewer` marker that still stands for the PR - its
current head, or an earlier head that `--delta` classes SAME or MECHANICAL
against it - is removed, with the one-line comment `merge-ready removed: no
review by a collaborator at <sha7>`. A label set by a non-collaborator
is not a review.

## 2c. Token cost comment - when a PR turns merge-ready

When a review ends with the PR labelled `merge-ready` (step 2b), the
dispatcher (this skill's caller, not the reviewer - only the caller sees
the agent's usage) posts one more PR comment with the estimated token
cost of getting that PR to merge-ready (user, 2026-11-10: "an average
token cost should be added as comment to each review based when its
merge ready").

- **What counts:** every agent run on this PR that the caller dispatched,
  plus the merge-ready review itself - each review and re-review
  (`PR-reviewer`), conflict-resolution or replacement-branch agents, and
  the fix agent for our own issue PRs. Take each run's token total from
  its completion notification (`subagent_tokens`) and its model. The
  caller's own main-session turns aren't attributable per PR and are not
  counted - say so.
- **Rate:** usage reports one total, not an input/output split, so
  estimate it as 90 % input and 10 % output at list price - a blended
  upper estimate (cache reads, billed at about a tenth of input, make the
  real cost lower). Blended per million tokens: Opus 5.5 about $5.60,
  Sonnet 5.5 about $2.80, Haiku 5.5 about $0.14. When list prices change,
  update these numbers from the `claude-api` skill's model table.
- **Comment shape** (one comment, first line is the marker so it's never
  posted twice for the same head):

  ```
  <!-- review-cost: <head sha> -->
  **Estimated agent cost to merge-ready:** ~$X.XX (N tokens)
  | Run | Model | Tokens | Est. cost |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | review | Sonnet 5.5 | 71k | ~$0.20 |
  | conflict fix (replacement #M) | Opus 5.5 | 64k | ~$0.36 |
  Blended upper estimate (90 % input / 10 % output at list price; cache
  reads make the real cost lower). Main-session coordination isn't
  counted.
  ```
- **Effort** (AGENTS.md "Every issue is weighted by effort"): under the
  total, add `Effort: <label of the issue the PR fixes>` and, if the issue
  escalated on the way, `(escalated from <label>)` - the data the effort
  table is recalibrated from. A Fable run is priced from the `claude-api`
  skill's model table.
- A run whose token total isn't known (e.g. a review from another
  session) is listed as "not known" and left out of the sum.
- No cost comment for `needs-rework`, `conflicts` or `needs-maintainer`
  verdicts; the next review that ends `merge-ready` sums every run on
  the PR so far (earlier rounds included).

## 2d. Process PRs - version bump and announcement

A PR that changes a process file (`AGENTS.md`, `.claude/agents/`,
`.claude/skills/`, `xtask/`, `.cargo/config.toml`, `scripts/gate.ps1`,
`scripts/gate.sh`, `scripts/release.ps1`, `scripts/collect-decisions.ps1`,
`scripts/collect-decisions.sh`) must increment
the integer in `.claude/PROCESS_VERSION` (AGENTS.md "Process changes bump
`PROCESS_VERSION`"). The reviewer checks this; a missing bump is a
requested change (`needs-rework`). When such a PR merges, whoever merges
it comments on the pinned issue #681 (Process changes):
`PROCESS_VERSION <n>` · PR #M · what changed · what a fork must do (usually
"pull the process files", the command in the issue body). That comment is
how fork maintainers subscribed to #681 hear about it.

## 3. Report

One short line per PR: number, author, verdict, link to the posted review.
If a review could not be posted, say why. Do not merge or approve, and set no labels beyond step 2b's review labels; do not
close anything; do not reply on the contributor's behalf.

## 4. Mirror claim comments - add and withdraw

A claim comment is a claim (AGENTS.md "A claim comment is a claim"): only
collaborators can set labels, so anyone else claims by commenting a line
that starts `claimed:` or `/claim`. The label only mirrors the comment. On
every run, after the PR steps, sync the two both ways.

**Add.** Find claim comments by anyone but the owner account (agents post
as the owner):

```bash
since=$(date -u -d '-7 days' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ 2>/dev/null || date -u -v-7d +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
gh api "repos/NeoTech/Camcraft/issues/comments?since=$since&per_page=100" --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select((.body|test("(^|\n) *(claimed:|/claim)"; "i")) and (.user.login != "NeoTech"))
        | "\(.issue_url|split("/")|last) \(.user.login) \(.created_at)"'
```

For each line `<N> <login> <time>`:
- **ended** - after `<time>`, `<login>` withdrew the claim in a later
  comment (`unclaim`, `/unclaim`, "claim withdrawn", "releasing this
  claim", "the issue is free"), or a comment says the claim was "released
  by the maintainer" or "released (stale ...)": skip silently. An ended
  claim's old comment is never mirrored again, whatever the claimant
  comments afterwards - only a NEW `claimed:` / `/claim` line is a claim
  (without this the Withdraw pass and this one would flip the label every
  run);
- **paused issue** (labelled `P?` - AGENTS.md "`P?` is paused"): do not
  mirror; reply once (only if no later comment mentions `@<login>`)
  `This issue is paused by the maintainer (P?) - it isn't open for work yet; the claim isn't recorded. It will be once the maintainer sets a priority.`;
- **closed issue**, or **already mirrored** (`claimed` set and `<login>`
  assigned, or `claimed` set and a "Claim recorded for @<login>" reply
  exists): skip silently;
- **held by someone else** - an earlier claim by another contributor is
  still LIVE (not ended, and it passes the liveness test below), or one of
  the owner account's agents holds a fresh claim (4 h rule): do not
  mirror; reply once (only if no later comment mentions `@<login>`) naming
  the current claimant. A stale or ended earlier claim holds nothing: if
  the earlier one is stale and not yet released, release it NOW (remove
  that claimant's assignment and post the stale-release comment from the
  Withdraw pass - it ends that claim), then judge this claim on its own
  merits. The label and the assignee always follow the newest live claim,
  and the Withdraw pass judges the claim of the current assignee;
- **stale** (AGENTS.md "A claim must be live"): the claim is not live -
  no open PR by the claimant for the issue, no commit on the claimant's
  branch for it in the last 48 hours, and no comment by the claimant on
  the issue in the last 48 hours (a comment that withdraws or releases
  the claim is not activity: ended beats live). Do not mirror; skip
  silently. Check
  liveness with
  `gh pr list --state open --author "<login>" --search "<N> in:title,body" --json number,headRefName`
  (then confirm the PR really is for this issue: its body or branch names
  `<N>`), the dates of `<login>`'s comments on the issue, and, for a
  branch the claim names,
  `gh api "repos/<login>/Camcraft/commits?sha=<branch>&per_page=1" --jq '.[0].commit.committer.date'`
  (the branch lives in the claimant's fork, so the owner in the path is
  the claimant's login; if the call errors - no such fork or branch -
  count it as no recent commit);
- **otherwise**: `gh issue edit N --add-label claimed --add-assignee <login>`
  (if GitHub refuses the assignee, add the label alone) and reply
  `Claim recorded for @<login> - label and assignee set (only collaborators can set labels; your comment is the claim).`

**Withdraw.** For every open issue carrying `claimed`
(`gh issue list --state open --label claimed --limit 200`), look for the
claim behind it: a claim comment by a non-owner (or an agent's `claimed:`
comment, which follows the 4 h rule instead). If the only claim behind the
label was a contributor's comment that is now deleted, or that contributor
later withdrew it (`unclaim`, `/unclaim`, "claim withdrawn", "releasing
this claim", "the issue is free" in their last comment), remove the label
and their assignment
(`gh issue edit N --remove-label claimed --remove-assignee <login>`) and
comment `claim by @<login> withdrawn - issue is free again`.
If the claim is neither withdrawn nor released but is **stale** (none of:
an open PR for the issue, a commit on the claimant's branch in the last
48 hours, a comment by the claimant on the issue in the last 48 hours),
remove the label and assignment the same way and comment
`claim by @<login> released (stale: no open PR, branch commit or comment from the claimant for 48 h) - issue is free again; claim it again with a new comment if you are working on it`.
An issue that carries a "released by the maintainer" or "released
(stale ...)" comment after its claim comment is free: never mirror that
old claim again. Never change the labels of a `P?` issue in this pass,
stale claim or not - list it in the report for the maintainer instead.
A label with no findable claim of any kind and no "Claim recorded" reply
was set by a collaborator by hand: leave it.

Report one line per mirrored or withdrawn claim; nothing found stays silent.

## Periodic run

`/loop 10m /review-prs` re-runs this every 10 minutes for the session
(recurring loops auto-expire after 7 days; cancel with CronDelete). Each tick is
a cheap `gh pr list`; an agent is only spawned when a fork PR has an
unreviewed head.
